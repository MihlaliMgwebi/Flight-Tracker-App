### Situation: 
I was tasked with creating a flight tracking app. I must:
- make use of the [opensky-network API](https://openskynetwork.github.io/opensky-api/rest.html#id10) to track ongoing flights.
- make a responsive layout with grid, flex, and media queries.
- show a list of ongoing flights.
- Use [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) with openstreetmap (it's the default used in all leaflet demos) to display a selected flight's current position on the map.

### Tension:
## Understanding the [Epoch Unix Timestamp](https://www.unixtimestamp.com/index.php):
The time in seconds since epoch is basically just counting how many seconds have gone by since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC. It's a way for computers to keep track of time and know exactly when things happened or need to happen.

## REST API Implementation
# How to use API
# How to extract data
# Get data with baseURL
# Data returned is undefined

### Action and Result.
## Website Converter
 I researched and used a website to mock input for parameters.

##
# Using the correct link
# Using map instead of forEach.


### Learning
##

##
#
# When to use map and when to use of forEach.
The forEach() method iterates over each element of an array whereas map() method returns a new array
